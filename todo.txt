Goal: 
  Create a simple react webpage with multiple react components
Description: 
  It really needs to be as simple as possible. No css styling necessary or anything like that

Todo =========================================


Done =========================================
[x] add several components to the react folder tree
[x] call them from the parent, order doesn't matter
[x] remove the unnecessary files from the starter app
  - I know they discussed what to remove in several videos, maybe check some of those out
[x] Create the react starter app
[x] Make my first commit
[x] Setup a git repo for the site
  - this helps me practice git at the same time
